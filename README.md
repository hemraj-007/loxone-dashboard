# Loxone Light Control with Socket.IO and React

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to control a Loxone Miniserver using a React frontend and a Node.js backend with Socket.IO. 
The setup allows for real-time control and monitoring of devices connected to the Loxone system, such as lights. 
The communication between the frontend and the backend is facilitated by Socket.IO, while the backend interacts with the Loxone Miniserver through its API.
